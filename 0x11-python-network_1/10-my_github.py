Python script that takes your Github credentials (username and password)
and uses the Github API to display your id

    You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access token as
    password to access to your information (only read:user permission is needed)
    The first argument will be your username
    The second argument will be your password
    (in your case, a personal access token as password)
    You must use the package requests and sys
    You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
    You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
